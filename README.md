# Color Palettes

Colors picked from around the Web or Montréal.
Convenient starting point for quick UI comps, slide decks, posters, moodboards etc.
No rights claimed; use at will.

<!-- NB: only save palettes with at least 5-6 usable colors; otherwise the repo gets filled with “mood” swatches that are never used. -->
