# Color Palettes

Colors picked from around the Web or Montréal.
Convenient starting point for quick UI comps, slide decks, posters, moodboards etc.
No rights claimed; use at will.

Palettes are available in PDF and ASE formats. PDF is general-purpose and can be opened in most OS and tools. ASE is specific to design tools, where it can be imported more efficiently (e.g. in Figma through [Palette Importer](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1067561134666722782/palette-importer)).

<!-- NB: only save palettes with at least 5-6 usable colors; otherwise the repo gets filled with “mood” swatches that are never used. -->

<!-- Any color from Topo Designs as well -->
